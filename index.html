              Blithe Cravens professional career and experience are what drew
              her to become involved in
              <span class="w3-large"><strong>The Sammy Center</strong></span>
              and serve on the board. Blithes background in Criminal Justice
              dates back to 1998. Since 2018 she has worked for the Salt Lake
              County District Attorney’s Office, as Senior Deputy District
              Attorney, Supervisor Family and Sexual Violence Unit.

              She once shared that if she can just keep one child out of the
              system she would feel like she has done a good thing. Difficult as
              it is to have the knowledge, and experience of what Blithe sees
              day-to-day, her commitment to making a difference and serving our
              community is a gift.
